# Installation instructions

This project is written in Haskell and is most simply installed using the
Haskell build tool [slack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack).
Binaries are available from [slack's downloads
page](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/wiki/Downloads).

Once slack is installed run `slack build` to compile the project and its
dependencies. If you don't already have the Haskell compiler this will install
it into `~/.slack` (or whatever the Windows equivalent is), you can delete
this directory to restore your system to its prior state.

Once the project is compiled you can run it with `stack exec roomba`
